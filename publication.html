                        A platform has been created by Innovation in which businesses have chosen activism and
                        functionalism against being influential and actionable and they turn any threat into an
                        opportunity by employing an innovative approach. Since 2019 when the Covid-19 pandemic appeared,
                        besides the contagious effect, it has influenced worldwide business in different aspects. It
                        might be interesting that most of the industries and companies are willing to continue their
                        businesses even after the pandemic with half of their capacity and teleworking. An epidemic of a
                        disease or a virus is not a new crisis and over time, developed and underdeveloped countries
                        have faced this crisis, but some manufacturers and owners have taken advantage of innovation to
                        turn threats into opportunities in business settings to create profitability and promote market
                        development of their products and services. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the need to take
                        advantage of innovation for stability, durability, and sustainability of businesses is felt more
                        than ever. In this article, we investigated economic and social policymaking at public levels
                        compared to the use of innovations and their consequences. Overtaking business competitors,
                        spreading the culture of innovation, creating new job opportunities, turning threats into
                        opportunities, long-term survival of businesses, and creating competitive advantages encourage
                        business owners to make more use of innovation in businesses during and after the Covid-19
                        pandemic.

                        Digital astronomical protractor device helps astronomers with observing the sky. A device that
                        can be used to find any information related to celestial body. A Device that does its work by
                        just targeting the linear laser placed on the machine. In this way, also the location and
                        temporal information of the place observations that be obtained automatically, can be used.
                        Today, to find the celestial bodies in observations, used of methods such as the method of hand
                        angle which is low accuracy and requires computer calculations with using spherical
                        trigonometric formulas, but in this device to enhance the accuracy and do not of calculations by
                        one, all these steps have provided automatically. The device has automatic exchange of
                        information for search and storage via SMS, Bluetooth and Wireless. In addition, this device has
                        the ability useful function for 48 hours continuously that this provides a perfect opportunity
                        for astronomers and observers in the night observations. Other abilities of this device can be
                        noted easy transport capability that it placed its own baggage and also the device make that
                        possible to put together and open a very simple that it can be ready to run in a short time.
                        Digital astronomical protractor device can be used on the side of normal telescope (without
                        engines) and provide more work for astronomers, and also compared the performance of the device
                        than other astronomical devices, the price is less.
